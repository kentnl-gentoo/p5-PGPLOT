CHANGES IN PGPERL FOR PERL5
---------------------------


v1.0a
-----

IMPORTANT: the binaries were not relinked (because most of the 
	   changes are cosmetic it made no difference and I was
           too lazy to do this for 4 architectures) so version
	   will still be reported as 1.0 by pgperlv. I ought to move
	   this routine from C into perl on the next major release...

o Changed pgperl.h to allow use of -DNO_TRAILING_USCORE
  in Makefile.PL with architectures where C calls F77 with no 
  trailing underscore (e.g. HP-UX).

o Fixed small typo in PGPLOT.pm which caused pgpnts not to
  work. (Ooops).

o Added user contributed Makefile.PL files for SGI and HP-UX 
  to distribution.

o Minor additions to documentation in response to common
  use problems.


v1.0
----

As described in README, README.perl5, pgperl.doc.
