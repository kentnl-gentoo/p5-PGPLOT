CHANGES (v2.0 from 1.0b) 
------------------------

o No longer providing perl4 version.

o All the array packing functions reimplemented in C to improve
  speed and robustness.

o Simplified build procedure - PGPLOT module should now build
  in standard Perl way. (i.e. 'perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; make
  install'). Makefile.PL should not have to be edited and upgrading
  should now be much easier.

o Added 'pass by reference' convention to allow explicit use of
  pre-packed binary data.

o Supports pgplot routines up to pgplot v5.1.1.

o Added POD documentation.

o FORTRAN link support is now via ExtUtils::F77 module (included).

o Now providing binaries of pgplot libraries for various
  architectures rather than statically-linked module binaries. This
  should make upgrading easier.

o Removed special one-point routine versions (hang-over from
  perl4 version).

o Removed pgplot.pl (again a hang-over from old perl4 version).

o General tidy up and reorganisation of distribution
