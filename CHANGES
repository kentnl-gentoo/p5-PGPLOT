LIST OF CHANGES IN PGPERL DISTRIBUTION
--------------------------------------

v1.0b  (for PGPLOT v5.0.2)
-----

o Updated to use PGPLOT v5.0.2 routines (two new ones: pgshs, pgqhs 
  which control fill-style cross-hatching - see PGPLOT documentation
  for details)

o Changed pgperlv (command that prints version info) - now part in
  perl and part in C. This makes it easier to update.

o Added perl4 Makefile's for the supported architectures and updated
  the instructions in file BUILDING accordingly.


v1.0a  (for PGPLOT v5.0.1)
-----

IMPORTANT: the binaries were not relinked (because most of the 
	   changes are cosmetic it made no difference and I was
           too lazy to do this for 4 architectures) so version
	   will still be reported as 1.0 by pgperlv. I ought to move
	   this routine from C into perl on the next major release...

o Changed pgperl.h to allow use of -DNO_TRAILING_USCORE
  compilation flag with architectures where C calls F77 with no
  trailing underscore (e.g. HP-UX).

o Fixed small typo in PGPLOT.pm (perl5 module file) which 
  caused pgpnts not to work. (Ooops).

o Added user contributed Makefile.PL files for SGI and HP-UX 
  to perl5 distribution.

o Minor additions to documentation in response to common
  use problems.

v1.0
----

As described in README, pgperl.doc.
